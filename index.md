<h2>Overview </h2>
Club Organizers is a centralized platform dedicated to showcasing the diverse range of student organizations at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. With over 150 Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) on campus, students have countless opportunities to get involved, connect with others, and pursue their interests. However, finding clear and up-to-date information about these organizations can be a challenge. Club Organizers aims to bridge that gap by offering an easy-to-navigate space where students can discover clubs, access contact details, stay updated on events, and engage with the vibrant UH Mānoa community.

<h2>Approach </h2>
Club Hub features three distinct user roles, all accessible through UH ID login.
* Students and general users can explore the club directory, discover new organizations, and find ways to get involved.
* Club Administrators have special access to manage their organization's profile, keeping information up to date for potential members.
* Super Administrators oversee the platform, ensuring content remains appropriate and accurate. They also have the authority to assign Club Admin privileges to eligible users.
